## Hi! I am R.Balaganesh from Achariya College of Engineering Techmology currently pursuing Computer Science and Engineering who is passionate about learning modern web development.  
# I am currently focusing on mastering the **MERN Stack** to build fast, scalable, and real-world web applications.

I believe in learning through practice and project development.

## **Objective**
The main objectives of this repository are:
- To learn and master full-stack web development
